# Implementation of Relational Algebra functions

### Aim of the Project

To write a program in C++ to implement Relational Algebra functions present in DBMS.

--------

### Functions implemented

The program implements the following Relational Algebra functions:





1. SELECT

2. PROJECT

3. RENAME

4. UNION

5. SET DIFFERENCE

6. CARTESIAN PRODUCT

Rest of the operations can be derived from these basic operations.

### Setup

Copy the whole folder. Open terminal inside folder and run
```
g++ dbms.cpp -o out && ./out
```
--------

### Project Details

In RA parser, the table names are allowed to be alphanumeric and attributes are allowed to be alphabets only. No table can have more than one attribute of same name. Also, Tables are implemented a Set, so duplicate records are not supported.

This RA parser supports following data types:
1. Integer
2. Double
3. Char
4. String
5. Bool

* All queries should be given in balanced parenthesis form, else they result in error.
*  Select may be used in place of `SELECT` as this is not case-sensitive. `select`, `sElecT` are also supported.
Same is for `PROJECT`, `RENAME`, `UNION`, `CART`, `SDIFF`.

#### Details of Operations

##### 1. `SELECT` Operation:
The basic structure of 'SELECT' query is
```
SELECT { Predicate } [ Table ]
```
`Select` may also be used in place of `SELECT` as this is not case-sensitive. Predicate has to be specified in Curly Brackets **{ }** and Table has to be specified in Square Brackets **[ ]**. Whole query should be in **Balanced Parenthesis** form.

The Predicate part of SELECT operation supports following operations on the above specified data types:

``` + - * / < > >= <= == != && || ! ``` (NOT for Bool datatype)
* `=` can also be used in place of `==`.
* `|` can also be used in place of `||`.
* `&` can also be used in place of `&&`.

Predicate has to be specified in **Infix** form and can use only **Parenthesis ( )** .

Example Predicates are as follows:

1. 
```
(Age>20 && Name!=”Ayush”) || (Salary/2 > 50000 && isCustomer==True)
```
Here isCustomer is of type **BOOL**. Operations may be performed elements of same data type only. However, in case of **INT** and **DOUBLE**, they may be operated with each other interchangeably.

2. 
```
(Salary > 200.45 && Sex=’F’)||( 3*Age + 30 < 90 ) || ( Salary=SalaryPrevious )
```
Here, Salary is in **INT** but may be compared with **DOUBLE**. Two Variables such as Salary & SalaryPrevious are allowed to be compared.

Sample query for SELECT operation:
```
SELECT { Age>20 && Sex!=’M’ } [ Student ]
```

##### 2. `PROJECT` Operation:
```
PROJECT {Attr1, Attr2, Attr3, ... } [ Table ]
```
**{}** should enclose the attributes and attributes should be separated by comma ‘*,*’. Table should be provided in **[ ]**. Projection of attributes not existent in Table will result in error.

##### 3. `RENAME` Operation:
```
RENAME {newTableName} [ Table ]
RENAME {newTableName | Attr1,Attr2,Attr3, ... } [ Table ]
```

##### 4. `UNION` Operation:
```
UNION [ TableA , TableB ]
```
Tables should be separated by a comma and tables should be enclosed in Square Brackets.

Tables should have exactly same schema i.e., names and datatypes of attributes and the order in which they are given should be same, otherwise it results in error.

##### 5. `CART` Operation:

Cartesian Product has been abbreviated to `CART`.
```
CART [ TableA , TableB ]
```

**TableA** and **TableB** should have completely disjoint schemas. If an user wants to product two tables with same name of attributes, then he/she must rename atleast one table to make this condition satisfy.

##### 6. `SDIFF` Operation:

Set Difference has been abbreviated as `SDIFF`.
```
SDIFF [TableA, TableB]
```

This returns **TableA** – **TableB**.

### Sample Queries

```
1. SELECT {} [Student]
2. SELECT {\*} [Course]
3. PROJECT {Name,Grade}[Student]
4. CART [Teacher, Course]
5. RENAME{Faculty|ProfName,ProfID,DeptID,Sex}[Teacher]
6. SELECT {(Sex=='F' && !isHosteler) || Grade > 8 && Grade < 9}[Student]
7. CART [ SELECT{predicate}[TableA] , PROJECT{Attr1, Attr2, ... }[UNION [TableB, TableC] ] ]
```
